# Description

XHawk87's Death Chests is a function pack for Minecraft.

When a player dies, their items are funnelled into a double chest at their feet instead of scattering out over nearby terrain. To avoid exploits, neither the chest nor hopper are droppable if destroyed. 

Warning: The appearance of the death chest and hopper may cause some blocks to be displaced

To use XHawk87's Death Chests in your game, copy the DeathChests.zip file to the desired world folder, under datapacks (e.g. .minecraft/saves/(world)/datapacks), and restart the game or use the /reload command.
