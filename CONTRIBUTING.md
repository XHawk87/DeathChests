# Contribution Guidelines

Please adhere to the following guidelines when submitting pull requests:

* Each pull request should resolve a posted issue. This helps to identify the reason why a change is needed
* Make an individual pull request for each distinct issue, to minimise the workload on individual changes, and to avoid confusing their purpose with other issues
* Proposed changes should be tested before submission, so we know that the project will still be in a working state for use
* Supply evidence of testing where possible. E.g. screenshots, chat logs etc
* Include GPLv3 or later copyright headers on any new files, this helps avoid any potential legal issues later on
* Annotate any commands without obvious function to make things easier for other contributors
* Don't forget to check spelling and grammar on any comments

Thanks for your help!
